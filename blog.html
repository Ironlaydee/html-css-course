        <p>The Privacy Guidelines are the cornerstone of the OECDâ€™s work on privacy and are recognized as the global minimum standard for privacy and data protection. They are a solid foundation for building effective protection and trust for individuals, and also for developing common international approaches to transborder data flows.</p>
